    <h1 >Defination of cool</h1>
<P>I'm a firm believer in the fact that every single one of us thinks that we  are in fact"cool".i think,err,know,that i am cool because of the clothes that i wear,my hair is cool,what i do is cool how i do things etc.Everything about me is sheer and utter coolness! i live cool and i breathe cool i even bieed cool i'll bet that i am way cooler than you, how do i know this? well, because i am cool simple right!  </p>
    <br>
    <h2 >Calculate cool</h2>
   <P>5% aspiration+ 95% self-perception+ 10% public awereness+46% individuality +15% action +22% verbal +99% what other think about wait this doesn't  add to 100%- but i guess that is my point coolness doesn't add up to 100 either.</P> 
   <h2>Ultimate coolness</h2>
   <P>Being as cool as i am going to go out on limb (cause that's what cool people do )and give you may my hypotheses of Ultimate colness. rest assured the fact me genully cool but i digress momentaly there is no real tangible coolness is what you think it is being cool is how youpreceive your world it is lest your coolnes and my theory? justbgo ask someone if they think you are cool they will look at you kind of funny quicly think about potentialy losing coolnsess by admitting to themselves that the persons asking os or colud than persons being asked and of course give you an answer.</P> 
   <h3>Not feeling cool?</h3>
   <P>have you always wanted to be the cool guy who always seems to do the right things? or are you dying to be the cool girl who flows through llife with ease and grae ? if you think about all the people who you think of as cool you'll find that they have servral characteristic in common teyre all confident unique and on friendly terms wih everyone there no resons you can't be like that  yourself. </P>
   <h3>Act Like You Don't Care </h3>
   <P>we will always on some level be connected with others opinions of ourselves but relise that ultimately you will never be able to please everyone so why bother trying? people have millions of ways to get under your skin learn to spot them and become immune bes happy and have fun</P>
   <h3> Learn to Laugh....At You!</h3>
   <P>being cool doesn't mean being perfect and being able to find humor in your moments of clumsiness and dis comfort is the defining hallmark of being cool people will not only respect you for it but they'll you for being human just like them. </P>
